The Internet is a global network connecting millions of computers, enabling the exchange of data and communication. It's an intricate system that has revolutionized how we interact and access information.

The Internet's Structure: It's a network of networks, where multiple smaller networks connect to form a vast web.
IP Addresses: Each device on the Internet is assigned a unique IP address, serving as a mailing address for data.

Data Transmission
TCP/IP Protocol: The foundation of Internet communication, ensuring data is sent and received accurately.
Packets: Information sent over the Internet is divided into small packets, each taking the most efficient route to its destination.

The Role of Servers and Browsers
Servers: They store and deliver web content. When you access a website, your browser requests data from a server.
Browsers: They interpret data from servers, displaying it as the web pages we see.

DNS and Routing
DNS (Domain Name System): Translates domain names into IP addresses. It's like a phonebook for the Internet.
Routing: Determines the best path for data packets to travel across networks.

The Internet is a marvel of modern technology,
