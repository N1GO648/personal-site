## **What is the internet?**

We need to define a "network" before we can discuss what the Internet is. A network is an assembly of linked computers with data transmission capabilities. A social circle, or a collection of individuals who know one another, communicate frequently, and plan events together, is similar to a computer network.

An enormous, interconnected network of networks makes up the Internet. Indeed, one could argue that the idea of interconnected networks is where the phrase "Internet" originated.

The Internet allows a computer in one network to communicate with a computer in another network that is located far away because computers link to one other within networks, and these networks also interact with each other. This enables fast information sharing between computers all across the world.

Through the use of wires, cables, radio waves, and other networking infrastructure, computers are connected to the Internet and to one another. All information transmitted via the Internet is converted into "bits," or electrical or light pulses, which are then read and understood by the computer on the other end. These bits are carried by radio waves, wires, and cables at the speed of light. The Internet operates more quickly the more bits that can travel via these wires and cables at once.

## **How does the internet work?**

Packets and protocols are the two fundamental concepts that govern the way the Internet operates.

### **Packets**

A packet in networking is a short chunk of a bigger message. Each packet includes data as well as metadata. In order for the receiving computer to know what to do with the packet, the "header," or information about its contents, comes before the packet. Consider how certain consumer items come with assembly instructions to get an idea of the function of a packet header.

Prior to being converted into bits, data travelling over the Internet is first divided into smaller packets. Switches and routers are two examples of the networking devices that route packets to their intended locations. The receiving device reassembles the packets in the correct sequence upon arrival at the destination, at which point it is able to utilise or display the data.

### **Protocols**

One of the greatest challenges that the people who created the Internet had to deal with was connecting two computers, each of which may run different software and use different hardware. Just as two individuals who were raised in different regions of the world would need to speak a common language in order to comprehend one another, it also calls for the usage of communications protocols that are intelligible by all linked machines.

The solution to this issue is found in standardised protocols. A protocol in networking is a defined method for carrying out specific tasks and arranging data so that two or more devices can communicate with and understand one another.

Protocols exist for transmitting data from one network to another (IP), for delivering data between devices on the same network (Ethernet), for guaranteeing that the packets arrive in the correct sequence (TCP), and for formatting data for websites and applications (HTTP). Apart from these basic protocols, there exist protocols regarding encryption, testing, and routing. Additionally, there are alternatives to the above-mentioned protocols for certain kinds of material; for example, UDP is frequently used for streaming video instead of TCP.

The Internet functions regardless of who or what connects to it because all computers and other devices with Internet access are able to interpret and comprehend these protocols.
