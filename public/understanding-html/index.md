HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It's the cornerstone of any web development journey, providing the structure and content of websites.

What is HTML?
HTML is a markup language that describes the structure of web pages using various elements.

Elements and Tags: Elements are the building blocks of HTML, defined by tags. Tags like: 
```jsx
<h1>, <p>, and <div> 
```
specify different types of content.

Basic Structure of an HTML Document
```jsx 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
DOCTYPE Declaration: Tells the browser the HTML version being used.

Head Section: Contains meta-information like the title and link to CSS files.

Body Section: The part of the document where visible content (text, images, etc.) is placed.

Common HTML Elements
```jsx
Headings (<h1> to <h6>): Define headings; <h1> is the most important.
Paragraph (<p>): For text content.
Links (<a>): Hyperlinks to other pages.
Images (<img>): Embed images.
Lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>): Unordered and ordered lists.
```

HTML Attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements, like setting a linkâ€™s URL in the
```jsx
 <a> 
 ```
 tag using the href attribute.

Semantic HTML
Purpose: Improves accessibility and SEO.

Elements: Such as 
```jsx
 <article>, <section>, <header>, <footer>, and <nav> 
```
provide clearer meaning.

HTML is the fundamental language of the web, essential for creating structured and meaningful content. Understanding HTML is the first step in any web development journey, paving the way for further skills in CSS and JavaScript.
